# Debug Workshop
Code Workshop for debugging

## The Problem
You are given 4 different folders each containing some buggy code. In each of these folders, you'll find a main function which contains a test case that contains some error(s). Below is a list of each folder, along with an explanation of what each does. I would recommend solving them top to bottom using the built in IntelliJ debugger.
## Palindrome
Checks if a given string is a Palindrome. A palindrome is a string which is the same in reverse. For example:
* hannah
* racecar
* noon  
## Frequency
Returns the most common char found in a string. For example, "aaa1bc" should return 'a' as the most common char since it appears three times. If the string is null or "", the method should return '-'.
## FrameFactory
Builds string frames of nxn. For example, the frame 3x3 is:  
\###  
\#&nbsp;&nbsp;#  
\###
